# retro-gfx
A tiny, simple VESA graphics library for DOS

# Building

1. Use Smaller C for Windows with NASM.
2. See build.sh in each example for how to build.
3. NASM and Smaller C must be in your path.
4. I build with the Windows x64 builds of NASM and Smaller C

# Acknowledgements

Thanks to Alexey Frunze for creating Smaller C which has allowed this experimental library to exist. 
Many of the routines were modified from his example code that is included with https://github.com/alexfru/SmallerC
