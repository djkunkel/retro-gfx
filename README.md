# retro-gfx
A tiny, simple VESA graphics library for DOS

# Building

1. Use Smaller C for Windows with NASM.
2. See build.sh for the command line needed to build. I will remove the relative copy from this script at some point.

# Acknowledgements

Thanks to Alexey Frunze for creating Smaller C which has allowed this experimental library to exist. 
Many of the routines were modified from his example code that is included with https://github.com/alexfru/SmallerC
